<h2 id="financial-report-01-draft-for-comment">Financial report 0.1 (draft for comment)</h2>

<p><strong>(<a href="https://github.com/okfnau/open-council-data/issues">Comments welcome!</a>)</strong></p>

<p>A financial report is a collection of spreadsheets put out each year by a council reporting on its financial activities over the previous financial year. It includes a balance sheet, income and expenditure statements, capital works programme and so on.</p>

<p>Several states have standard (Microsoft Excel based) formats in which these reports are written and submitted to a central authority. The OpenCouncilData standard given here is a machine-readable (CSV) format that closely mirrors the <a href="http://www.dtpli.vic.gov.au/local-government/publications-and-research/planning-and-reporting">Victorian Local Government Model Financial Report</a>. Councils in other states should follow a similar process for their state’s model financial report, if it exists.</p>

<p>Each of the different components of the report (balance sheet, capital works programme etc) should be published as a separate CSV file. We recommend publishing them all as resources (files) within a single dataset (CKAN package), for open data platforms that support that kind of structure.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: unlike the Excel-based format, CSV files should <em>not</em> include any subtotals such as “Total income” or “Total non-current assets”.</p>

<p>CSVs are grouped such that all the numeric values within one file have the same “direction”, and can thus be meaningfully summed. For example, liabilities must be subtracted from assets, so they are in a separate file.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All values should be in thousands of dollars. (That is, <code>300</code> means $300,000)</li>
  <li>Do not include $ signs or commas.</li>
  <li>Remember that category names containing commas must be enclosed in double quotes: <code>"Plant, machinery and equipment"</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="balance-sheet---assets">Balance sheet - assets</h3>

<p>This is the template to be followed, with a sample value of $1,234,000 for the first item. <code>2016</code> should be replaced with the current year, and <code>1234</code> represents the actual value that would be included (in thousands of dollars). Multiple years can be included as additional columns.</p>
